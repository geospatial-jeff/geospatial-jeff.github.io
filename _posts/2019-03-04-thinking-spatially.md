## Introduction
In 1953, Watson and Crick published a 2-page paper proposing a three-dimensional, double-helix model representing the physical structure of DNA.  Although the complete history of the discovery of DNA is out of the scope of this post, it's worth nothing that none of the research teams including Watson and Crick were close to an answer until an X-ray diffraction image (famously called Photograph 51) was captured in 1952, revealing a two-dimensional cross section of crystallized DNA.

Watson and Crick's proposed answer then required fitting a three-dimensional spatial model to the existing two-dimensional representation provided by Photograph 51 and based on their understanding of the molecular and structural requirements of DNA.  

Albert Einstein famously did not start speaking until he was 4 and described his thinking processes as primarily verbal, stating "the words or the language, as they are written or spoken, do not seem to play any role in my mechanism of thought" but rather "elements in thought are certain signs and more or less clear images which can be 'voluntarily' reproduced and combined".  The thought processes used by the aforementioned scientists exemplify the process of <b><i>spatial thinking</i></b>, which [uses space as a vehicle for structuring problems, finding answers, and expressing solutions](https://books.google.com/books?id=_VQwdVNVhOgC&pg=PT191&lpg=PT191&dq=uses+space+as+a+vehicle+for+structuring+problems,+finding+answers,+and+expressing+solutions&source=bl&ots=KsKqOFrhoq&sig=ACfU3U1opJK-6_oiJK4qqW4Q666tWhwQkA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiIlunZupzhAhUM5oMKHYEbDikQ6AEwAHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=uses%20space%20as%20a%20vehicle%20for%20structuring%20problems%2C%20finding%20answers%2C%20and%20expressing%20solutions&f=false).  

## Spatial Thinking
Every single person on Earth relies on spatial thinking every day but it's such a natural part of our thought process that it becomes really hard to define, difficult to uncouple from our daily lives.  Is it likely that the spatial thinking employed by Einstein to imagine the universe in innovative ways is the same process used by Watson and Crick to develop the double helix?  Most likely not.  The scientists were born in different locations with different academic upbringings with expertise in different fields trying to solve fundamentally different problems.  Spatial thinking happens to be incredibly individualized and use-case driven, which means there really is no way to assign a proper universal definition.  Instead, I'd like to examine what it means to think spatially by decomposing the concept into its smaller parts.

The most authoritative source for thinking about spatial thinking is the National Research Council's 2006 report titled [Learning to Think Spatially](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/11019/learning-to-think-spatially), which conceptualizes spatial thinking as "a constructive amalgam of three elements: concepts of space, tools of representation, and processes of reasoning", which are described in the table below:

| Element | Definition     |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Space       | Provides the conceptual and analytical framework within which data can be integrated, related, and structured.       |
| Representation       | Provides internal and cognitive or external and graphic forms within which structured information can be stored, analyzed, comprehended, and communicated to others.       |
| Reasoning       | Provides the means of manipulating, interpreting, and explaining the structured information     |

This is actually quite simple!  In order to think spatially we need to (1) define our space, (2) choose some way to represent our space, and (3) use our sense of spatial reasoning to assert something about our representation.

##### Concepts of Space
One of the really cool and powerful aspects of space is that it is ambiguous, amorphous, and generally up to interpretation.  Space can be a concrete thing (such as an architect's scale model of a building), a graphical/numerical representation (such as lat/long points in a GIS), an abstract concept (such as clustering social media users by shared connections) or a mental abstraction (such as a taxi driver's mental map of a city).

##### Tools of Representation
Representations help the thinker remember, understand, and communicate about the properties of and relationships between objects represented in space.  They are necessary because space is simply too individualized and too complex to explain in its entirety; representations thus provide a simplified model of our space which promotes interaction, communication, and understanding.  Perhaps the most powerful example of a spatial representation is spatial data!  The raster and vector data models are simply computerized representations of various real-world objects and phenomenon within a defined concept of space.

##### Processes of Reasoning
Spatial reasoning is the underlying set of spatial tools at our disposal used to assert information about the given representation.  An architect may assert spatial reasoning by performing various measurements on a scale model, an intelligence analyst may identify an unknown object by examining its appearance in multiple satellite feeds.  Once again, the process behind spatial reasoning varies across use-cases but is ultimately grounded in the individual's spatial literacy, which is acquired through education, experience, and intuition.  Unlike the previous two aspects of spatial thinking, there are definitely correct and incorrect forms of spatial reasoning (ex. there are known methods to accurately measure distances).


## Geospatial Thinking
Geospatial thinking is an extension of spatial thinking used whenever our concept of space is the Earth.  As the name suggests, geospatial thinking is spatial thinking with an explicit focus on geography.  But why is geography important?  Because not all space is the same, even if it appears to be.  The tendency of individuals to think about space differently means that individuals also utilize space differently.  One of the founding principles of geography is spatial autocorrelation, which states that "everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things."  Applied to our previous statement and we realize that individuals who are close to one another utilize space similarly, a concept known as culture.  Keep in mind that "close" is a spatial comparison, and can refer to really any concept of space.  Individuals who frequent the same blogs are likely like minded in their opinions just as those who live in the same city are likely to be fans of the same sports team.

Since spatial thinking and its many derivatives are personalized, I can only really speak to my own experiences.  The flavor of geospatial thinking I've come to use most is data-driven, as my primary use case is generating actionable intelligence from spatial data.  In this scenario, the primary concept of space I work with is the Earth, the representation is spatial data (such as a satellite image), and the reasoning is performed primarily with a GISystem.  My ultimate goal is to use spatial reasoning to assert information about the space (Earth!) using my representation (the data!) as a vehicle for communicating my assertion in a way that informs decision making processes.

Fully understanding the given representation is the most critical element of any type of spatial thinking, as the representation ultimately allows the thinker to communicate, interact, and derive information from the underlying space.  Representations are simply models of the underlying space so its useful to know a little about modeling theory!  Thankfully, whether we know it or not, we are all experts at modeling and have been perfecting our modeling skills our entire lives!


## Modeling Theory 101
To give an overview of modeling theory I'd like to propose an extended metaphor.  Think about the word <b><i>TREE</i></b>.  I'm sure a similar mental image pops into most people's mind.  But think about how much more complex the physical manifestation of a tree is compared to the four letter word we use to represent it.  It's so complex that we've come up with other words like <b><i>LEAF</i></b> and <b><i>TRUNK</i></b> to describe various parts of the tree.  Each one of those words has even more associated words to help give us a better understanding of what the word TREE actually represents.

**<center>Figure 4: Tree related vocabulary words.</center>**


Words are nothing more than models for the objects they represent, so anyone with a vocabulary is familiar with the concept of modeling!  It turns out that modeling is a fundamental aspect of how humans understand and communicate about information.  Without models, we lose the ability to simplify the world around us, creating an overwhelming mess of stimuli which quickly overwhelms our little brains.  Models, however, give us the power to understand the world around us through simplification.

If models are the building blocks of information, combining multiple models through contextualization is the key to understanding.  When we are children we may simply understand that trees are tall, green, and fun to climb on.  But as we grow up so does our tree-related vocabulary; we learn new and fancy words like PHOTOSYNTHESIS which build on our mental understanding of what a tree actually is.  Understanding what photosynthesis is on its own isn't too useful, but understanding how it works with respect to the tree and all its various parts build understanding.  Similar to how we can build understanding of a TREE through the combination and contextualization of its various parts, spatial data can also be layered to build our understanding of the Earth through a process known as data fusion.

##### Spatial Data Fusion
Perhaps the most explicit example of data fusion is dimensionality.  The vast majority of spatial data is two-dimensional, presenting a "top-down" model of the world.  Unfortunately, this isn't a useful model in a lot of applications because the world is three-dimensional (four if you count time).  Humans can typically visualize three-dimensional representations of of overhead imagery due to third-dimension artifacts (shadows, contours, edges etc.) but computers cannot which complicates certain analyses.

<img src="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gang_Chen46/publication/322367962/figure/fig5/AS:667627512950801@1536186211894/Residential-versus-commercial-buildings-from-2D-to-3D-image-credit-Google-MapC.png" style="width:400px;"/>
**<center>Figure 5: The effect of dimensionality.</center>**

Sticking with our tree metaphor, lets pretend we want to identify individual trees from a satellite image.  A human operator could easily do this by hand but it would take quite a while, so let's try and automate the process!  It's fairly easy to find all the vegetation in the image with a spectral index like NDVI, but how can we differentiate trees from other types of vegetation?  A commonly way to add dimensionality is by fusing elevation data (LIDAR, DEM etc.) with overhead imagery.  The resulting product depicts a three-dimensional representation of the world much better suited for identifying trees; we can differentiate between trees and grass by the object's height and maybe even distinguish between tree species based on canopy structure.

## Spatial Data and Geospatial Thinking
Geospatial thinking gives us a sandbox for experimenting with the world.  A chemist who has discovered a new molecule has a variety of options at his disposal.  He can look at the molecule under a microscope.  He can try heating it up or cooling it down, or maybe mixing it with other molecules.  Each experiment he performs builds his understanding of the molecule under study.  The same is true for geospatial analysts, but the tools are spatial data and a GIS.  We can mix and match; add and subtract; warp and translate; and generally do whatever we want to spatial data as long as the output is useful to our application and our process is sound.  Each disparate data source we bring into the analysis adds a unique representation which builds a larger, more robust, and more realistic picture of the world.

Geospatial thinking is often a bottom up process.  We start by learning everything there is to know about the specific problem we are trying to solve.  This subject-matter expertise is always important because it builds our understanding of the physical, biological, spatial, cultural etc. properties of the problem we are trying to model.  We use the information we have gained combined with our knowledge of spatial data to identify which source(s) are useful to our application.  We then fuse the identified sources to create a realistic model of the world which (hopefully) enables the solution to our problem.  If it doesn't, we take the knowledge we've gained and head back to the drawing board.  This process enables successful geospatial analysis by ensuring that the combination of data inputs paints a realistic and useful picture of the world.

## Geospatial Thinking and AI
If geospatial thinking is critical to geospatial analysis, then it's worth examining its relationship with artificial intelligence.  After all, AI methods such as machine/deep learning are quickly becoming the most popular analysis frameworks for spatial data.  I often question the role of artificial intelligence within the geospatial community.  It seems to usually be implemented as a silver bullet solution to identify a specific feature with a data strategy along the lines of "throw stuff at the wall and see what sticks".  This is a dangerous approach and could not be more opposite from the process of data fusion which explicitly requires making informed, data-driven decisions based on one's understanding of the underlying problem.

This isn't a knock on AI, per say, and has more to do with the long-term success of old-school geospatial analytics.  Traditional methods have been used and will continue to be used for decades to perform extremely complex geospatial analysis but are severely limited when it comes to scaling due to the sheer amount of human and technical resources required to sustain a large project.  This is really where machine/deep learning frameworks become attractive; as they provide the capability to efficiently scale traditional, well-known, and well-tested methods of geoanalytics to global scale.

To examine this further, lets look at two examples of interesting applications which combine spatial thinking and AI to create a compelling analytic.  The first example shows how good geospatial thinking can inform a good data strategy.  The second example shows how geospatial thinking may be embedded directly into the learning framework itself.  The third example is the exception, and shows how AI can be strategically leveraged to develop capabilities not previously possible with traditional methods.

##### Example 1: Descartes Labs Tree Canopy Identification
You can probably tell by now that I think trees are an interesting application, so lets talk about trees some more.  [Descartes Labs](https://www.descarteslabs.com/) recently built a [machine learning model](https://medium.com/descarteslabs-team/descartes-labs-urban-trees-tree-canopy-mapping-3b6c85c5c9cc) to identify tree canopy from satellite imagery.  Ground truth was created by identifying areas of known canopy cover using lidar data and NAIP imagery (~1 meter aerial R/G/B/NIR).  The model was then trained to identify trees from ~1 meter aerial/satellite imagery but without the lidar!  The use of machine learning here is really innovative because Descartes isn't really using machine learning to identify trees, but rather remove the lidar dependency from identifying trees.

The identification, classification, and measurement of trees has been around forever, and was one of the first major applications of civilian remote sensing enabled by the launch of Landsat-1 in 1974.  A simple search on Google Scholar for "remote sensing tree" returns papers dating back to the 1950s using spatial data in tree-related applications.  The first mention of elevation data in forestry is in a [1969 paper](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2307/1933693) describing a technique for estimating forest foliage using SRTM data.  These early methods relied on low resolution and less accurate data and couldn't get as granular as the per-tree analysis achievable today but ultimately laid the groundwork for the next half century of tree-related remote sensing research.  It wasn't until [~1985](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10106048709354119) when researchers started successfully fusing multispectral imagery and lidar data for vegetation studies.  Since then, the data fusion between lidar and overhead imagery has improved exponentially, mostly due to advancements in the georegistration of overhead imagery and more efficient lidar collection/processing/visualization methods.

Although it is a well studied topic, the identification of trees is overwhelmingly manual due to a lack of data coverage.  Manual efforts are highly accurate but incredibly time expensive (New York City's 2015-2016 tree count took [12,000 man hours](https://www.citylab.com/environment/2018/12/urban-tree-canopy-maps-artificial-intelligence-descartes-labs/578701/)).  If we had lidar and high resolution overhead imagery acquired during the same season for the entire world someone would have already identified all of the trees using non-machine learning methods many years ago.  But the unfortunate fact is that lidar is incredibly expensive and relies on a collection method which inherently generates spotty data coverage, so global lidar coverage is a dream for the future when [Geigar-mode lidar](https://www.harris.com/solution/geiger-mode-lidar) inevitably takes over the world.

Descartes Labs data strategy on this project is innovative because it builds from past research while using machine learning to strategically improve on well-known methods by removing a data dependency which has severely limited such methods.  Descartes isn't really creating a new algorithm, rather improving an old one with currently existing tools.  Their algorithm [isn't perfect](https://www.citylab.com/environment/2018/12/urban-tree-canopy-maps-artificial-intelligence-descartes-labs/578701/) but has given them quite the mileage considering how simple the entire thing actually is, serving as a good example for how spatial thinking can inform AI data strategy in geospatial applications.

##### Example 2: EarthDefine GEOBIA Tree Identification
The Descartes Labs implementation is nice but what if we wanted to map each individual tree rather than the entire canopy?  The analysis becomes much more difficult because we not only have to identify where all the tree pixels are but also accurately assign each tree pixel to it's respective tree.  A human (who is thinking spatially!) trained in forestry, remote sensing, and image interpretation can manually identify individual trees quite easily in a remotely sensed image if tree density is low to medium.  Such a task in densely forested areas would require complementary leaf-on/leaf-off imagery in addition to multi-return lidar data to perform with high accuracy.

One solution is Geographic-Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA), defined as ["a sub-discipline of Geographic Information Science (GIScience) devoted to developing automated methods to partition remote sensing imagery into meaningful image-objects, and assessing their characteristics through spatial, spectral, and temporal scales"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226439936_Geographic_Object-Based_Image_Analysis_GEOBIA_A_new_name_for_a_new_discipline).  GEOBIA is at the intersection of a lot of [interesting disciplines](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijgi/special_issues/GEOBIA) like machine learning, computer vision, remote sensing, GIS, geostatistics, and geography.  Because GEOBIA relies on many of the same characteristic used in spatial reasoning, I conceptualize GEOBIA as embedding spatial thinking into a machine learning framework.

![test](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maggi_Kelly/publication/259298362/figure/fig7/AS:203108731887623@1425436303520/Principle-of-the-iterative-workflow-in-GEOBIA-Initially-generated-image-objects-are.png)
**<center>Figure 5: High-level overview of GEOBIA framework.</center>**

GEOBIA is different from traditional raster analysis in that the smallest analytic unit is an image-object instead of pixels.  Image-objects are created through segmentation and then classified via an interactive process which incorporates subject matter expertise described through ontology and enforced with a rule set.  The image object hierarchy allows the classification of smaller image patches to inform that of larger patches and vice versa which allows GEOBIA to make intelligent classifications based on complex phenomenon like spatial structure and composition.  GEOBIA projects have historically been limited in scale due to computational and data limitations, but companies like [EarthDefine](http://www.earthdefine.com/) are building high throughput platforms for performing GEOBIA.  I'm especially impressed by their [SpatialCover Tree Dataset](http://www.earthdefine.com/spatialcover_trees/) which identifies individual trees using the same inputs used by Descartes but at a much smaller scale.

The use of spatial thinking within machine learning frameworks is intriguing because the whole discipline is built on biological plausibility.  If biological plausibility is an important characteristic of successful machine learning and spatial thinking is an important characteristic of human thought it makes a lot of sense to marry the two and see what happens!

## Conclusion
Spatial thinking lets us make sense of the world by using space as a vehicle for structuring problems, finding answers, and expressing solutions.  It provides a powerful and holistic framework for thinking about spatial data which enables successful geoanalytics by ensuring that the underlying data strategy builds an accurate model of the world which promotes interaction, communication, and understanding.

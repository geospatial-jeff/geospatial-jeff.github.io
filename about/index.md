**Cognition** is a set of tools for building customizable cloud-based serverless architectures for
serving and analyzing raster data (and eventually vector) from cloud data stores.  The architecture leverages the interoperability and efficiency of Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF's stored in a spatially cognizant flat file structure to create efficent patterns of access to the underlying data.  

## Goals
* Enable sensor-level and product-level data fusion.
* Enable on the fly geo-processing and image-processing.
* Enable ingest and metadata handling of common datasources (Landsat, Sentinel etc.).
* Enable visualization of geospatial datasets.

## Features
* Deployed with [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/) (AWS Lambda/SNS/SQS).
* [Cloud Optimized GeoTiff](http://www.cogeo.org/)
* [STAC](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec) Compliant

## Getting Started
Coming soon...
